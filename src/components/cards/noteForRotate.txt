
To map a set of numbers from 400 to 500 to a corresponding set of numbers between 0 and 130, you can use linear scaling. Here's how you can do it:

Calculate the range of the original set of numbers and the desired set of numbers:

Original range: 500 - 400 = 100
Desired range: 130 - 0 = 130
Calculate the scaling factor by dividing the desired range by the original range:

Scaling factor: 130 / 100 = 1.3
For each number in the original set, subtract 400 to shift the range to start from 0, and then multiply it by the scaling factor to obtain the corresponding value in the desired set:

Corresponding value = (Original number - 400) * Scaling factor
Here's an example to demonstrate the mapping process:

Original set: {400, 401, 402, ..., 499, 500}
Desired set: {0, 1.3, 2.6, ..., 127.7, 130}

Let's calculate the corresponding values for a few numbers in the original set:

Original number: 420
Corresponding value = (420 - 400) * 1.3 = 26

Original number: 450
Corresponding value = (450 - 400) * 1.3 = 65

Original number: 490
Corresponding value = (490 - 400) * 1.3 = 117

By applying this method to each number in the original set, you can obtain the corresponding set of numbers between 0 and 130.

To normalize the numbers between 200 and 400 to a range of 50 to 100, you can use the Min-Max Normalization technique. Here's how you can do it:

Determine the original range of the data: In this case, the original range is from 200 to 400.

Determine the desired range: The desired range is from 50 to 100.

Apply the Min-Max Normalization formula: Subtract the minimum value (200) from each data point and divide it by the range (400 - 200 = 200). Then, multiply the result by the desired range (100 - 50 = 50) and add the minimum value of the desired range (50). The formula can be expressed as:

normalized_value = ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) * (max_range - min_range) + min_range

where:

x represents each data point
min(x) is the minimum value of the original range (200)
max(x) is the maximum value of the original range (400)
min_range is the minimum value of the desired range (50)
max_range is the maximum value of the desired range (100)
Plug in the values and calculate the normalized values for each data point using the formula.

For example, let's normalize the value 300:

normalized_value = ((300 - 200) / (400 - 200)) * (100 - 50) + 50
= (100 / 200) * 50 + 50
= 0.5 * 50 + 50
= 25 + 50
= 75

So, the value 300 is normalized to 75 in the range of 50 to 100.

Repeat this process for each data point within the original range to obtain the corresponding normalized values within the desired range.
